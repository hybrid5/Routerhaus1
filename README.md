# RouterHaus

This repository hosts the RouterHaus website. All web files live in the `docs/` folder so the site can be served via GitHub Pages.

## Viewing locally
Open `docs/index.html` in your browser to explore the site without a web server.

## GitHub Pages
Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings and choose the `docs/` folder as the source. The site will then be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.
The `docs` folder also includes a `.nojekyll` file so assets are served as static files without any Jekyll processing.
